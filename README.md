First I set up my [git homework repository](https://github.com/klarraga/BIOL-653-Larraga-Katrina-hw.git) to my local computer. 

Then I opened up **R Studio** and selected "create a new R markdown". I titled the new file as "README", and *saved* it as an .md file in my local folder "R_Projects".

I will then save my .md file, **add** and **commit** it to git, and push it onto github.

Odd thing I noticed: To make a new paragraph, instead of adding "two spaces" at the end of a line (*like it says to do so on the cheatsheet you gave us*), I noticed it didn't work. So I tried using *enter* and it worked. Does this happen to you too?
